### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**randomaccess3/randomaccess3** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on too much stuff; ThisWeekin4n6, ThinkDFIR, CyberCX, SANS FOR500, SANS FOR528
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ransomware TTPs and NTFS file system stuff!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DFIR!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @phillmoore on Twitter/BlueSky/InfoSec.Exchange/LinkedIn
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm sure I can think of something, or maybe I'm not fun? Probably that :)
