### Hi there 👋

<!--
**randomaccess3/randomaccess3** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on too much stuff; ThisWeekin4n6, ThinkDFIR, CyberCX, SANS FOR308, SANS FOR500
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python/Powershell
- 💬 Ask me about DFIR!
- 📫 How to reach me: @phillmoore on Twitter
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm sure I can think of something, or maybe I'm not fun? Probably that :)
